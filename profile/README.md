# Game Park On Sui

What arcane enigmas the game bequeaths dwell

In the sanctum of thine own cognition alone

As with thy monetary coffer's celestial course

Its existential prerogative rests in thy sovereign scroll

## Introduction

Integrate blockchain technology into traditional web2 games, while maintaining game operation consistency as much as possible, give value to in-game props, and truly realize "Play To Earn"!

[Game Park Market](https://github.com/Game-Park-On-Sui/game-park-market) is the core, providing unified game currency exchange and in-game props trading functions.

[BlackSquid Jumping: Remastered](https://github.com/Game-Park-On-Sui/blacksquid-jumping-remastered) and [Fight For Dove](https://github.com/Game-Park-On-Sui/fight-for-dove) are two completely different game types, but both are deeply integrated with **Sui**. Whether it is NFTs storing game data or roguelike props, they can be traded freely in the market. ~~Who says luck isn't part of wealth?~~

Is that all?

No!

The connectivity between different games is the next focus of "Game Park"! In the future, this will be a huge game ecosystem, and the behavior in any game may have an impact on other games.

Yes, this will build "Game Life"!

Please remember:

Life is more than games, yet life is blessed with games!

The future will be forged by you and me, together!
